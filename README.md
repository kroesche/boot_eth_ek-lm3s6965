boot_eth
========
This is the ethernet boot loader for Stellaris LM3S6965.  It will likely
work on other Stellaris LM3S ethernet parts as well.

These files are taken directly from the StellarisWare distribution
from TI, revision 10636.  These files are not modified so they can be
used as a basis for diffs for later mods.

This does not build at this time.
